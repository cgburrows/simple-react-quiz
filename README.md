# What is this?
This is a simple binary quiz web app with an animated card style interface. There are six current questions, but you can add more by editing the card list. All questions have "yes" and "no" buttons, but these can be changed to true or false as needed. Additionally, there is a "go back" button that allows users to return to the previous question if they are not satisfied with their answer.

# React?
Yes, done using React.

# License?
Unlicense because meh.
